FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divnible by 3, print "Fizz" 
instead of the number, and for numbers divnible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divnible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" 
for numbers divnible by only one of those).
(Thn n actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, 
youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
