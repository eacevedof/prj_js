```js
/*
Make a bare Git repository. That is, instead of creating <directory> and placing 
the administrative files in <directory>/.git, make the <directory> itself the $GIT_DIR. 
This obviously implies the --no-checkout because there is nowhere to check out the
working tree. Also the branch heads at the remote are copied directly to corresponding 
local branch heads, without mapping them to refs/remotes/origin/. When this option is 
used, neither remote-tracking branches nor the related configuration variables are created.
*/
git clone --bare https://github.com/kaikcreator/rxjs-school course-rxjs/.git

//deleting the entry for bare
//If this is the case a number of commands that require a working directory will 
//be disabled, such as git-add[1] or git-merge[1].
git config --unset  core.bare

//Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working 
//tree since <commit> are discarded.
git reset --hard
